This is a (toy!) project that I built during the 2-day-long Juction Hackathon 2024.

# 🏢 What is BIM?
You have probably seen architects and engineers in movies drawing 2D blueprints and handling them to construction companies to make things like buildings and bridges. That's the way we have built for a long time, but now there's a better way: BIM.

BIM stands for Building Information Model. In a nutshell, instead of drawing each blueprint one by one, we make a 3D model (M) with information (I) of the object to build (B). We can then generate all the 2D blueprints automatically from that 3D model. This has many advantages: errors in the design can be detected earlier, the design process is more traceable, we can make simulations, etc.

# 💪🏻 What is this project?
It's a simple 3D BIM Web application, written in JavaScript / TypeScript.

In terms of features, you can:
- 🏢 Import, display, navigate, edit and export your IFC file.
- 🔎 Find your objects of interest based on their categoty and property!

# Final Words
Speaking from experience, I think building a 3D web app is a good incentive for an AI engineer to learn JS and TS :)
